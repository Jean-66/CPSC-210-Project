This application is designed to provide tailored 
recommendations for **dog food** based on specific 
criteria, such as dog's characteristics like size and age. 
Users, specifically **pet owners**, will input information of *the 
dog's size (big or small) and the dog's age*. The output will then suggest
suitable types of dog food for the given circumstances.

The target audience of this project includes pets' 
owners seeking guidance for appropriate dog food for
their dogs. As a dog lover and a pet's
owner, this project is of great interest to me because
this is an essential opportunity to combine my interest
in technology with the human's most indispensable 
partner, contributing to their well-being. Dogs has 
brought so much happiness to human world, they deserve
to be treated well.
