# Fill the Bellies!

## Introduction


This application is designed to provide tailored 
recommendations for **dog food** based on specific 
criteria, such as dog's characteristics like size and age. 
Users, specifically **pet owners**, will input information of *the 
dog's size (big or small) and the dog's age*. The output will then suggest
suitable types of dog food for the given circumstances.

The target audience of this project includes pets' 
owners seeking guidance for appropriate dog food for
their dogs. As a dog lover and a pet's
owner, this project is of great interest to me because
this is an essential opportunity to combine my interest
in technology with the human's most indispensable 
partner, contributing to their well-being. Dogs has 
brought so much happiness to human world, they deserve
to be treated well.


## Detail Information


- X is the brand of dog foods. Y is the list the brands which would be called suitable brands for the given dog.
- Each X includes dog food particle size, price ($), and their effects such as bone growth, boost immunity, and smooth hair.
- The application is going to analyze which kind of dog food is suitable for the specific dog based on the input. *For example, small dogs would prefer small particle food, as well as young dogs need nutrition to help develop their bones*.

## Phase 4: Task 2
- Events logged since application started:
- Wed Apr 03 15:59:17 PDT 2024
- Dog food named may has been successfully added!
- Wed Apr 03 15:59:25 PDT 2024
- There are 2 brands of dog food suitable for your dog.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- For further enhancement, the addition of a back button at the conclusion of the tailor button would be beneficial. This feature would allow 
users to navigate back to the previous page, thereby mitigating the inconvenience of having to rerun the program. Currently, upon tailoring a 
dog food list for their dog, the page remains within that section, necessitating a more seamless navigation option.
- Additionally, the aesthetics of the frame could be refined to enhance user appeal. This could involve incorporating visually pleasing elements 
such as background imagery for both the frame and buttons. Enhancing the appearance of the application is crucial for attracting and retaining users, 
as the visual presentation plays a significant role in user experience and engagement.
